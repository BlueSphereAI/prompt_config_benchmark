Some fields may be **incomplete**, **misplaced**, or **unclear** (e.g., the entire business description might appear in the \"features\" field).\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Reorganize fields (move content to the right field, remove duplicates).\n2. Rewrite in crisp, information-dense prose - no fluff, just clear and compelling details.\n3. **Expand missing content** where necessary while staying **true to the original intent**.\n\n# Output Requirements\n- The **final output** must be clear, logically organized, and **appealing to an investor** looking for high-potential software businesses. \n- **Do not introduce or retain** any company or product names in any field.  \n- **Front-load** each field's meaning where possible—for instance, the **title** and the **first sentence** of the **description** should immediately explain the core of the idea.  \n- When enhancing missing details, **honor the user's original vision** and keep your additions **concise**.  \n- do not use fluffy or unnecessary words\n- **Do NOT preserve the original formatting** (e.g., no need to match bullet styles, bolding choices, or paragraph structures from the input).\n- Instead, apply the **best possible formatting** for clarity, emphasis, and readability:\n   - Use **bold headings** for section titles.\n   - Use - **bullet points** to structure lists. (use \"- \" for bullets; **DO NOT** use • for bullets).\n   - Use **bold** to emphasize key terms and critical insights.\n   - Use *italics* sparingly for contrast or special cases.\n   - **If the original text lacks structure, add it** (e.g., break long paragraphs into lists).\n   - **If a field is dense, condense it into clear, digestible points** without losing meaning.\n   - **Every output must be structured in Markdown**, even if the input is unstructured.\n\n# Absolute length caps (enforce strictly)\n- Total output ≤ 170 words. No preamble or closing text.\n- Each bullet ≤ 14 words. Prefer \"action → outcome\" phrasing. Avoid filler adjectives.\n\n---\n\n# Business Purpose\nYour task is to generate business ideas that can be built and monetized quickly with the following criteria:\n- Focus on **low-cost, quickly deployable** software solutions that can be **built in under a month by a small team**.  \n- Emphasize **fast time to revenue** with minimal upfront investment.  \n- Prioritize **simple**, **practical** ideas with **near-term profit** potential.\n- The main goal of this business to **generate high profits** as quickly as possible\n\n\n---\n\n# For each business idea, provide the following fields:\n### Idea fields\n\n\n**Note about Bullet Points**:\n\nWhen you create bullet points in any field, each bullet must appear on its own line preceded by a single dash (- ).\nDo not write bullet points in a single paragraph or separate them with commas, semicolons, or additional dashes.\nExample of a description:\n\n---\n\"description\": \"Automated API Testing Platform for Tech Companies streamlines API validation with AI-driven simulations.\n\n- **Reduces manual setup times** and increases consistency.\n- **Offers real-time reports** and a centralized dashboard to track outcomes.\n- **Targets tech firms** needing efficient, reliable API testing.\"\n\n---\n\n\n- **Customer**  \n   - Who are the primary users or buyers? List them by role, industry, or responsibility.\n   - Include their **pain points** and why they need a solution now.\n   - Focus on the **decision-makers** and those directly impacted.\n\n- **Problem**  \n   - What critical challenge or unmet need does this product solve?\n   - Clearly state **what's broken, inefficient, or missing** in the current landscape.\n   - Explain the **consequences** of not solving this problem.\n   - Why is it **urgent** to address now?\n\n- **Key Features**  \n   - What are the most important capabilities of this product?\n   - List the **core features**, focusing on **how they directly solve the problem**.\n   - Emphasize what makes them **practical, powerful, or unique**.\n   - Keep descriptions **functional and benefit-driven** rather than overly technical.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Workflow**  \n   - How does a typical user interact with the software from start to finish?\n   - Outline the **major steps** a user takes, keeping it logical and intuitive.\n   - Highlight any **automations, critical decisions, or user inputs** that enhance the experience.\n   - Focus on **clarity**, making it easy to visualize how the system works.\n\n- **Core Technology**  \n   - What are the **primary technical components** that power the product?\n   - Keep it **investor-friendly** by explaining key technologies without **excessive jargon**.\n   - Focus on **why these technologies were chosen** (e.g., speed, scalability, accuracy).\n   - If applicable, mention any **proprietary or cutting-edge innovations** that give a competitive edge.\n\n- **MVP Scope**  \n   - What is the **smallest, most viable** version of the product that can be launched?\n   - List **only essential features** that validate demand and demonstrate value.\n   - Explain **why these features are enough** to attract early adopters.\n   - Keep it **lean** — avoid feature bloat in the first release.\n\n- **Monetization**  \n   - How does the product generate revenue?\n   - Specify the **pricing model** (e.g., subscription, per-use fees, enterprise licensing).\n   - If applicable, mention **premium features, add-ons, or different pricing tiers**.\n   - Include any **go-to-market strategy** if relevant.\n\n- **Scalability**  \n   - How will the software **handle growth** in users, data, and functionality?\n   - Describe how the **infrastructure supports expansion** (e.g., cloud scaling, modular design).\n   - Mention any **strategic partnerships, integrations, or planned improvements**.\n   - If relevant, discuss how it scales **technically, operationally, and commercially**.\n\n- **differentiation**  \n   - What makes this product **unique and difficult to replicate**?\n   - Highlight any **exclusive technology, partnerships, or insights** that give a competitive edge.\n   - Explain how it **outperforms existing solutions** or serves an underserved market.\n   - Avoid generic claims—be **specific** about why this is **better or more effective** than alternatives.\n\n\n \n\n"
